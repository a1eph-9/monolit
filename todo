fix the save bug - not done
finish work on file integrity checker - done
integrity checker is finished, just write a script to test it, it definitely works
i did some tests and it generates the same thing as in the file when loading
but i want to see it working - in progress
i figured out why the hash was changing between two values, because every time its loaded the entries get reversed in order - figured out
